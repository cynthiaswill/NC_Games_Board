# NC Board Game Reviews API

## Background

This is a **back end API**. The intention here is to mimick the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which provides information to the front end architecture.

The main database is built with PSQL by using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

The Live Chat is separate and built with mongoDB cloud database.

I have combined the express server and socketIO server into one single listener.

### The hosted version of this **backend API** is available at:

- https://nc-games-board.herokuapp.com/api

### This API provide data to the front end app available at:

- Front End Git Repo:
  - https://github.com/cynthiaswill/nc-board-game-reviews
- Front End hosted version:
  - https://quizzical-bohr-776a6e.netlify.app/reviews

#

## Step 1 - Setting up your project

- Tested minimum version of Node v16.13.1.
- Clone the entire repo into a local folder, type 'npm install' in terminal to install all dependencies before running the app.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cynthiaswill/NC_Games_Board.git
$ cd NC_Games_board
$ npm install

```

- You will need to create _two_ `.env` files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). Double check that these `.env` files are .gitignored.

- You have also been provided with a `db` folder with some data, a [setup.sql](./db/setup.sql) file and a `seeds` folder.

## Step 2 - Creating tables and Seeding

- After installed dependencies, you will need to run the following in terminal to setup database

```
$ npm run setup-dbs
```

### Creating Tables

You need to complete the provided seed function to insert the appropriate data into your database by running following scripts:

```
npm run seed
npm run seed-test
```

This will create tables
`categories`, `reviews`, `users` and `comments`.

Each category have:

- `slug` field which is a unique string that acts as the table's primary key
- `description` field which is a string giving a brief description of a given category

Each user have:

- `username` which is the primary key & unique
- `avatar_url`
- `name`

Each review have:

- `review_id` which is the primary key
- `title`
- `review_body`
- `designer`
- `review_img_url` defaults to `https://images.pexels.com/photos/163064/play-stone-network-networked-interactive-163064.jpeg`
- `votes` defaults to 0
- `category` field which references the slug in the categories table
- `owner` field that references a user's primary key (username)
- `created_at` defaults to the current timestamp

Each comment have:

- `comment_id` which is the primary key
- `author` field that references a user's primary key (username)
- `review_id` field that references an review's primary key
- `votes` defaults to 0
- `created_at` defaults to the current timestamp
- `body`

### You can then start the server by running:

```
$ npm start
```

You can also use

```
$ npm run dev
```

to start development server, which will automatically re-seed the data, or typing:

```
$ npm run test
```

to run test by jest, which will re-seed a pool of test data automatically.

## Endpoints

**Essential endpoints**

```http
GET /api/categories
GET /api/reviews/:review_id
PATCH /api/reviews/:review_id

DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id
GET /api
```

```http
GET /api/users

```

---

All endpoints send the responses specified below in an **object**, with a **key name** of what it is that being sent. E.g.

```json
